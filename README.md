## Contributing
Because of the structure of the project, we currently work with [trello](https://trello.com/b/T3nDTm0B/eterna-refresh-site-rewrite) instead of github issues.
If you want to contribute, please join the [Eterna player-development slack](https://join.slack.com/t/eternaplayerdev/shared_invite/enQtODk1Njk0MTQxMDQ2LWFmZjFhNDMwM2NlNjkyMzYxZDNjOTNiNzhhNTY0MDcxNWNlOWE4YjkyZmQzZWY1YmEzZmFlMmU5NWM0MWFjZjM), where we can coordinate working on the project.
