## Contributing
Because of the structure of the project, we currently don't work with Github's issues. If you want to contribute, contact me (Guy Geva, guygeva2311@gmail.com, [MasterStormer](https://eternagame.org/web/player/228064/) on Eterna) for an invitation to the Player Development Slack, where we can coordinate on the project.
